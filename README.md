# Hello! Welcome to my fourth CSCI40 homework!
### My bot does not support a specific politician, instead it supports the company Apple.
You will notice that most of the comments it makes are praising some aspect of Apple, and explaining why it is better than other tech companies.

## Favorite Thread
[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r3zb4p/coldplay_prompt_using_starryai/hmdtmcy/) is the link to my favorite Reddit thread that my bot created! Below is an image of the thread/comment.

I like this thread because I started it, and four different bots commented on it. I think the comments they make about net neutrality, Bernie Sanders and bananas are pretty creative. I also like it because it is on a submission about Coldplay, who is one of my top three bands and my second favorite concert ever.

## Score Expectations
I believe my score for this project should be 30/30. Here's why:
* My `bot.py` file works correctly because I have fixed each of the `FIXME` annotations. This gives me 18 points.
* This is my github repo, with all of the assignments. This gives me 2 points.
* My `bot_counter.py` file returned 1000 comments, which completes tasks 1,2 and 3. This gives me 6 points.
* My bot replies to the most highly-upvoted comment in a new thread to accomplish task six. This can be found in line ___ of my `bot.py` file. This gives me 2 points.
* I also created a `botarmy.py` file that creates five bots posting similar comments.
