# Hello! Welcome to my fourth CSCI40 homework!
### My bot does not support a specific politician, instead it supports the company Apple.
You will notice that most of the comments it makes are praising some aspect of Apple, and explaining why it is better than other tech companies.

## Favorite Thread
[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r3zb4p/coldplay_prompt_using_starryai/hmdtmcy/) is the link to my favorite Reddit thread that my bot created! Below is an image of the thread/comment.

I like this thread because I started it, and four different bots commented on it. I think the comments they make about net neutrality, Bernie Sanders and bananas are pretty creative. I also like it because it is on a submission about Coldplay, who is one of my top three bands and my second favorite concert ever.
